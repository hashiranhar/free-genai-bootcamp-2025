### Examples

Here are examples of user input and assisstant output, pay attention to the score and why the example is scored the way it is

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>5</score>
    <score_reasons></score_reasons>
    - Bad: In the vocabulary table it did not show the Japanese characters, the cells are just blank
    - Bad: The beginning sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocaublary table
    - Bad: Sentence structure is bad, we want something conceptual as such : [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
    <assisstant:output>
    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a table of vocabulary to get you started:
    | Japanese	| Romaji	| English
    |           | kuma	    | bear
    |           | tobira	| door
    |           | gomi	    | garbage
    |           | noko	    | leave (behind)
    |           | soto	    | outside
    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. Here's a possible order:
    [Subject] + [wa/ga] + [Location] + [ Verb ] + [ ka/shi ] + [Question]?

    Can you think of how to express "at the door" in Japanese?

        - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediatly
        - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence strucutre
        - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations

        Cheatsheet:
        | Word | Japanese | Type |
        |------|----------|------|
        | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
        | door | ドア | Noun |
        | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
        | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
        | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

        Sentence structure:
        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Considerations:
        - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
        - The first part is stating a location where something exists
        - The second part is asking about a past action

        Possible next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location marking
        - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
        - ask clues about question formation
        - ask clues about verb conjugation
